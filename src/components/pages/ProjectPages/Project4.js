      <h1>Master's thesis: Mitigating False Information on Social Media</h1>
        <p className="projectDesc">With my focus on encouraging sustainability and justice through 
          technology, my academic research aims to tackle the issue of false information (i.e. mis- 
          and disinformation) spread through social media platforms.</p>

        <p className="projectDesc">An overarching goal of contribution for this research is to 
          maintain social sustainability through democracy and enabled through their right of 
          proper information to the users of social media platforms.</p>

        <p className="projectDesc">My fields of interest within informatics for this topic are 
          CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) and Social Computing, both concerned with 
          the entanglement of technology with everyday life, and acknowledging the social aspects 
          and phenomena involved with technological advancements.</p>
