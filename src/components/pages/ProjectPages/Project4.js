        <p>❝<strong>Title:</strong> Understanding the Role of Technology and Community Interactions in the Lived 
          Experience of Online False Information❞</p>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <span>A Phenomenological Perspective on Encounters with False Information through Sense-making, 
        Social Interactions, and Media Literacy</span>
        <p className="projectDesc">With my focus on encouraging sustainability and justice through 
          technology, my academic research aims to tackle the issue of false information (i.e. mis- 
          and disinformation) spread through social media platforms.</p>

        <p className="projectDesc">An overarching goal of contribution for this research is to 
          maintain social sustainability through democracy and enabled through their right of 
          proper information to the users of social media platforms.</p>

        <p className="projectDesc">My fields of interest within informatics for this topic are 
          CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) and Social Computing, both concerned with 
          the entanglement of technology with everyday life, and acknowledging the social aspects 
          and phenomena involved with technological advancements.</p>

          <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
          <p className="projectDesc">Interactions is essential in understanding how to support media 
            literacy and encouraging technological democratization with a focus on people’s lived 
            experiences underlining their right to rightful information. For handling this issue, 
            discerning design implications with a focus on promoting media literacy provides a step 
            towards this democratization, attempting to mitigate the harmful effects of false information.</p>
