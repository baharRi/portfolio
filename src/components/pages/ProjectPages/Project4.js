        <p>In the class of IN3010: Transformative Design, with a focus on social sustainability, my design team partnered with the established core team from AtomIQ to create a wireframe of the interaction design layer of their upcoming investment app.

Contributing with our creativity as design students, we developed a novel interface layout; attempting to ease the intimidation of existing crypto currency investment apps, we displayed the investment companies in the form of cards on a dashboard for the user. 
This followed our design model of dividing the often overwhelming experience of crypto investment into smaller “bite-sized” chunks of informative content, contributing to democratizing the financial sector through education and empowerment. </p>
